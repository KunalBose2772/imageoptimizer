4.5 AI Execution Mandate (Unambiguity Clause)
To ensure the highest quality output and zero ambiguity when using Cursor AI:
Full Integration Required: Every specified feature (especially Dark Mode, Responsive Text Sizing, and Component Usage) must be fully implemented and functional in the code, not just simulated or partially represented.
Tailwind Consistency: Use the dark: prefix for all style changes related to the Dark Mode NFR.
Validation First: The AI must confirm that all required reusable components are functional and correctly integrated before proceeding with the core logic of a new page.

4.6 ReactBits.dev Integration Workflow
ReactBits.dev (https://reactbits.dev) is a resource providing high-quality, production-ready React components and patterns. Integration follows this workflow:
User Provides ReactBits.dev Code: The user will share specific ReactBits.dev component code or patterns they want implemented.
AI Adapts for Project: The AI will integrate the ReactBits.dev code by:
- Converting styling to Tailwind CSS (removing any CSS-in-JS or custom CSS)
- Applying the global green color scheme (#007BFF) and Lexend font
- Ensuring mobile-first responsive design
- Integrating with existing project components (Header, Footer, Layout)
- Following project conventions (single CSS file, no inline styles, no !important flags)
User Guidance Integration: When the user specifies which ReactBits.dev components to use, the AI will implement them following the above adaptation process.
Quality Assurance: All ReactBits.dev integrations must maintain the same high-quality standards as the original components while perfectly fitting the project's design system.

// FULL STACK PAGE BUILD TEMPLATE: [Tool Name]

**Tool Goal:** Build the complete, functional [Tool Name] page. Ensure it adheres strictly to the existing Next.js/Tailwind/Lexend project setup and uses reusable components (Header, Footer, Layout).

**URL Path:** /[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10232774/how-to-find-sitemap-xml-path-on-websites/](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10232774/how-to-find-sitemap-xml-path-on-websites/)

**Front-End Requirements (FE):**
1.  **Layout:** Use the global `Layout` component.
2.  **H1 Tag:** Set the title prominently: `[H1 Title - e.g., Convert AVIF to JPG Online for Free]`.
3.  **Tool UI:** Integrate the reusable **File Uploader Component**. Specify file selection:
    * **Selection Type:** [Single File / Multiple Files / URL Input].
    * **Accepted Input Formats:** [List of Input File Extensions].
4.  **Post-Upload UI:** [Describe specific post-upload options for this tool - e.g., Quality Slider, Reordering UI].
5.  **Action Button:** Create a prominent primary button labeled **"[Action Verb] [Output Format]"**.
6.  **ReactBits.dev Integration:** If user provides ReactBits.dev components, adapt them by:
    * Converting to Tailwind CSS styling
    * Applying global green color scheme (#007BFF)
    * Ensuring Lexend font usage
    * Maintaining mobile-first responsive design
7.  **SEO Prep:** Implement the complete structured **SEO Content Block** (dummy or specific content) below the tool interface.

**Back-End/Functionality Requirements (BE):**
1.  **API Endpoint:** Create the corresponding local Next.js API route: `/api/[category]/[tool-function]` (e.g., `/api/pdf/merge`).
2.  **Core Logic:** Write the **Node.js/Python** logic placeholder for this task.
    * **Primary Library:** [Specify the required library - e.g., Sharp, FFmpeg, PyMuPDF, GhostScript].
    * **Logic Summary:** [Briefly describe the server-side operation].
3.  **End-to-End Workflow:** The FE must send files to the BE endpoint, the BE must process them, and the FE must offer the resulting file in a prominent **Download Box**.
4.  **Error Handling:** Implement checks for invalid file types.

**Integrity Check:** The tool must be fully functional end-to-end (upload, process, download) before proceeding to the next page on the sitemap.

5.4 Independent File Creation & Development Philosophy
**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** Each page/tool must be developed as a completely independent, self-contained unit while maintaining shared infrastructure.

**File Independence Requirements:**
- **Complete Functionality:** Every tool page must work independently without dependencies on other pages
- **Shared Infrastructure:** All tools use the SAME reusable components (Header, Footer, Layout, FileUploader, ActionButtons)
- **Shared Styling:** All tools use the SAME global CSS file with Tailwind classes (NO code duplication)
- **Shared JavaScript:** All tools use the SAME utility functions and hooks (NO code duplication)
- **Isolated Testing:** Each tool must be testable independently
- **Modular Architecture:** Tools can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately
- **No Cross-Tool Dependencies:** Tools should not rely on functionality from other tools

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION - NO CONFLICTS WITH EXISTING REQUIREMENTS:**
‚úÖ **Single CSS File:** All tools share the same global styles.css file
‚úÖ **No CSS Duplication:** Each tool uses existing Tailwind classes, no new CSS files
‚úÖ **No !important Flags:** All styling uses standard Tailwind classes
‚úÖ **Shared Components:** Header, Footer, Layout, FileUploader used across ALL tools
‚úÖ **Shared JavaScript:** Utility functions, hooks, and helpers shared across ALL tools
‚úÖ **No Inline Styles:** All styling through Tailwind classes in the shared CSS file

**What "Independent" Means:**
- Each tool has its own page file (e.g., /pages/image-tools/avif-to-jpg.js)
- Each tool has its own API endpoint (e.g., /api/image/avif-to-jpg.js)
- Each tool can be developed without affecting other tools
- Each tool can be tested in isolation
- Each tool can be deployed independently if needed

**What "Independent" DOES NOT Mean:**
- Creating separate CSS files for each tool
- Duplicating JavaScript code across tools
- Creating separate component files for shared functionality
- Using inline styles or !important flags

**CONCRETE EXAMPLE - How Independence Works:**
```
Project Structure:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.css (SINGLE CSS FILE - used by ALL tools)

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdf/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ merge-pdf.js (INDEPENDENT - its own API)

Each tool page imports and uses the SAME shared components:
import Layout from '../../components/Layout'
import FileUploader from '../../components/FileUploader'
import ActionButton from '../../components/ActionButton'
```

**Development Phase Structure:**
**Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-2)**
- Complete project setup and homepage development
- Establish design system and component library
- Create reusable components (Header, Footer, Layout, FileUploader, ActionButtons)

**Phase 2: Core Tools Development (Steps 3-28)**
- Develop each tool as independent pages
- Each tool = 1 complete page with frontend + backend + testing
- No tool development until previous tool is 100% complete
- Maintain consistency with established design system

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Steps 29+)**
- Build remaining tools following same independent approach
- Add advanced features and optimizations
- Scale and optimize based on Phase 2 learnings

5.5 Quality Assurance & Validation Framework
**MANDATORY VALIDATION PROCESS:** Every page/tool must pass these checks before proceeding to the next.

**Pre-Development Validation:**
- **Design System Compliance:** All components must match established homepage design
- **ReactBits.dev Integration:** If applicable, user-provided components properly adapted
